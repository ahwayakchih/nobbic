==========================

## `remove` APP_NAME

To just remove single installation of NodeBB, use following command line:

```sh
nobbic remove my-new-forum
```

Of course, replace `my-new-forum` with whatever name you used to create it with the [`start` or `build`](./start.markdown) action in the first place.
